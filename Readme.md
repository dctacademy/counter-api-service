## Project Name: **Counter API Service**

### Description:

The Counter API Service is a lightweight, RESTful web service built on Node.js with the primary focus on managing and manipulating individual numeric counters. Through its endpoints, it offers clients the ability to create, read, update, and delete counters, and to adjust their numeric values based on predefined operations.

### Key Features:

1. **List All Counters:** Users can retrieve a complete list of all counters currently stored within the system.
  
2. **Unique Counter Identification:** Every counter is uniquely identified using a timestamp-based ID, ensuring that each counter can be individually accessed and managed without conflicts.

3. **Value Manipulation:** Users can easily increment, decrement, or reset specific counter values, allowing for real-time adjustment based on user interactions or events.

4. **JSON-based Persistent Storage:** All counter data is securely and efficiently stored within a JSON file. This ensures data retention across system reboots and easy backup or transfer.

5. **Robust Error Handling:** The API provides clear error messages, making it user-friendly and easy to debug. Whether a counter is not found or there's an issue with the operation type, users are kept informed.

#### Potential Use Cases:

- **Web-based Click Counters:** Developers can implement this API to track and display the number of clicks on specific elements or pages.
  
- **Polling Systems:** For systems that track user preferences or votes, each option could be represented by a counter.

- **Performance or Event Trackers:** In scenarios where specific events (like downloads, uploads, or user logins) need to be tracked, each event can be a counter that increments with each occurrence.



| Method | Endpoint                 | Query Params      | Body  | Description                                                           | Response                                       |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/counters            | -                 | -     | Retrieves the list of all counters                                    | JSON array of counters or an error message      |
| POST   | /api/counters            | -                 | `{}`  | Creates a new counter with an autogenerated ID and initial value of 0 | JSON object of the newly created counter       |
| GET    | /api/counters/:id        | -                 | -     | Retrieves a counter based on the provided ID                          | JSON object of the specific counter            |
| PUT    | /api/counters/:id        | type=increment, decrement, reset | -     | Updates the counter's value based on the type query param            | Updated JSON object or an error message        |
| DELETE | /api/counters/:id        | -                 | -     | Deletes a counter based on the provided ID                            | JSON object of the deleted counter              |

### Additional Notes:
1. For the POST endpoint `/api/counters`, the body doesn't necessarily need to contain any specific information as it is mostly auto-generated. The ID is generated based on the current timestamp and the value is always set to 0.
2. The PUT endpoint `/api/counters/:id` expects one of three values in the query parameter `type`: 'increment', 'decrement', or 'reset'. Depending on the value, it increments, decrements, or resets the counter value to 0.
3. If any operation fails, typically because of file reading/writing issues, the error message is sent as the response.
4. If a specific counter is not found for the GET, PUT, or DELETE operations, an empty JSON object `{}` is returned.
